INTRODUCTION
------------
This contains all relevant projects showcasing my abilities presented in my CV. Within this project are five courseworks and one summer project.


Computational Linear Algebra
----------------------------
'computational linear algebra' contains the projects related to the Computational Linear Algebra course (academic year 2020-2021), there are two projects, each corresponding to a coursework. It also contains 'cla_utils' that refers to optional weekly exercises that were set as part of this course, some of which were utilised in the projects. Within each project folder can also be found the question sheet.

1. Coursework 1 (project_1) constituting to 20% of the module.

2. Coursework 2 (project_2) constituting to 80% of the module.

As per the course requirements the project pdf does not include the code, which can instead be found in python files named according to the question which they solve.


Methods for Data Science
------------------------
'methods for data science' contains the projects related to the Methods for Data Science course (academic year 2020-2021), there are two projects, each corresponding to a coursework. 

1. Coursework 1 (project_1) constituting to 40% of the module.

2. Coursework 2 (project_2) constituting to 60% of the module.

It should be noted that the solutions are self contained within the project html (ie the report contains all code used for the project).



Stochastic Simulation
---------------------
This project constituted a 25% coursework for the Stochastic Simulation course (academic year 2020-2021). Within the 'stochastic simulation' folder is the question sheet, as well as my written report, as a pdf and as a .rmd file. As with Methods for Data Science, solutions are self contained within the project pdf and contain all code used for the project.


Student Shapers project
-----------------------
This project pertains to the summer research project during Jun 21 â€“ Aug 21. Due to the large size of the data analysed it has been omitted, leaving the data_analysis, report and mindmap which were produced for this project.
